        Common issues with payments
      </h1>

<!-- HELP -->

<p>
  Occasionally, something can go wrong with a payment. These are the most common issues:
</p>


<h2 id="help-with-debit-cards" class="heading-medium mtp-help__section">
  Payment did not reach the prisoner
</h2>

  <p>
    <!-- When you make a transfer at a bank branch or from an international bank account, your payment won't go through. That means we can't credit the prisoner and you'll have to request a refund. <a href="#">Please follow these steps</a>. -->
    On rare occasions a payment can take longer than 3 days. In most cases the money has arrived but not yet gone into the prisoner’s spend allowance. Wait a few more days then if you’re still concerned <a href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder">contact the prison</a>.

      <p>Please note, this does not apply to debit card payments which can be made from overseas, as long as they are made by Visa or Mastercard.</p>

        Bank transfer was refunded unexpectedly
</h2>

      <p>
        You may have used an incorrect prisoner reference in your bank transfer so we cannot identify the prisoner. The refund will be from ‘GBS RE NOMS AGENCY’ in your bank statement. The prisoner reference used must be exactly as written.

      </p>

            Confirmation email was not received
              </h2>

                <p>
                  If you paid by debit card, please check your spam/junk folder. Otherwise, you may have mis-typed your email address but the payment will still have gone through.

                  <p>
                    The money will be transferred to the next prison. If they moved to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/about/hmps/contracted-out">private prison</a> the process may take longer.

                          In either of these cases we will be unable to verify your identity. That means we can’t pass on your money to the prisoner and you’ll have to <a href="/help/request_a_refund">request a refund</a>.

                You'd like a refund
              </h2>

              <p>
                      Refunds aren’t possible. You can’t cancel a payment once it’s been sent. You only get a refund if you tried to do a bank transfer but used an incorrect reference. However, if the prisoner has been recently released, they can <a href=" https://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder">contact the prison</a> and request their money.
