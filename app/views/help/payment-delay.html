        A payment has taken longer
      </h1>

      <p>In almost all cases, the payment reaches the prisoner’s bank account in up to 3 days.</p>
      <p>However, if it seems to be taking longer, it could be because an individual prison has put a payment on hold or the money could be in the prisoner's account but the prisoner doesn’t know about it yet.</p>
      <p>If you’re still worried after 7-10 days, please <a href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder">contact the prison</a>.</p>
