<!-- HELP -->

<p>
  Occasionally, something can go wrong with a payment. You may receive an unexpected refund, the prisoner may have not received the money or you may suddenly be unable to use the service.
These are the most common errors:
</p>

  <!-- The prisoner has not recieved the money -->
  <!-- While the money is likely to have reached the prison in 1-3 working days, it may not have been credited to the prisoner yet. Sometimes the money has been credited to the prisoner's account but the prisoner has not yet been able to view their account balance. -->

  I made a bank transfer but my money was returned
</h2>

      <p>
        You may have used an incorrect reference. If so, you’ll get a refund within 4 working days of making the bank transfer. Your bank statement will show ‘GBS RE NOMS AGENCY’ and the reference will be ‘REFUND’.
The prisoner will not have received the money.
      </p>

        I may have the wrong prisoner details
      </h2>

        <p>
          The prisoner ‘date of birth’ and ‘prisoner number’ must both be correct to make a payment. Check first with the prisoner to make sure you both have the same details. If you do but still can't use the service, ask the prisoner to check with the wing officer that their details are correct on the database.

              <p>
                Sometimes payment can take longer for various reasons. For example, individual prisons can put a payment on hold or the money could be in the prisoner's account but they don't know yet.
    If you're still worried, please <a href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder">contact the prison</a>

                  If you paid by debit card, please check your spam/junk folder. Otherwise, you may have mis-typed your email address but the payment will still have gone through.

                  <p>
                    The money will be transferred to the next prison, whether it’s a <a href = "https://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder">public</a> or private prison. If it’s a <a href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/about/hmps/contracted-out">private prison</a> the process may take longer.
