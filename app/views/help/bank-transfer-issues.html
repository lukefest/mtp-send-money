        A bank transfer was returned or didn’t reach the prisoner
      </h1>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">If your bank transfer was returned</h2>
      <p>The money sent to you was returned because you may have used an incorrect reference.</p>
      <p>If so, you’ll get a refund within 4 working days of making the bank transfer. Your bank statement will show ‘GBS RE NOMS AGENCY’ and the reference will be ‘REFUND’.</p>
      <p>No money will reach the prisoner.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">If your bank transfer didn’t reach the prisoner</h2>
      <p>It could be because you made a transfer at a bank branch or from an international bank account. If you do this, your payment won’t go through.</p>
      <p>That means we can’t credit the prisoner and you’ll have to request a refund.</p>
      <p>To request a refund, <a href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder">find the prison address</a> and write to the prison.</p>
      <p>Address your letter to the ‘Business Hub’ and confirm:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>your name</li>
        <li>your address</li>
        <li>the prisoner’s name</li>
        <li>the prisoner number</li>
        <li>the amount and date you paid</li>
        <li>the bank branch where you made the payment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The prison will send you a refund by cheque.</p>
