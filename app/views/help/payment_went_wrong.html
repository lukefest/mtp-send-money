<!-- HELP -->

<p>
  Occasionally, something can go wrong with a payment. You may receive an unexpected refund, the prisoner may have not received the money or you may suddenly be unable to use the service.
These are the most common errors:
</p>


      <h2 id="help-with-debit-cards" class="heading-medium mtp-help__section">
  <!-- The prisoner has not recieved the money -->
  I made a bank transfer but my money was returned
</h2>

      <p>
        <!-- While the money is likely to have reached the prison in 1-3 working days, it may not have been credited to the prisoner yet. Sometimes the money has been credited to the prisoner's account but the prisoner has not yet been able to view their account balance. -->
        You may have used an incorrect reference. If so, you’ll get a refund within 4 working days of making the bank transfer. Your bank statement will show ‘GBS RE NOMS AGENCY’ and the reference will be ‘REFUND’.
The prisoner will not have received the money.
      </p>

        <!-- The money was returned to you unexpectedly -->
        I may have the wrong prisoner details
      </h2>

        <p>
          The prisoner ‘date of birth’ and ‘prisoner number’ must both be correct to make a payment. Check with the prisoner and the wing officer to make sure you all have the same details before you try to make a payment.
        </p>

              The money will be transferred to the next prison, whether it’s a public or private prison. If it’s a <a href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/about/hmps/contracted-out">private prison</a>

                          Refunds aren’t possible. You can’t cancel a payment once it’s been sent.
      You only get a refund if you tried to do a bank transfer but used an incorrect reference.
      However, if the prisoner has been recently released, please contact the prison and <a href="/request_a_refund">request a refund</a>
