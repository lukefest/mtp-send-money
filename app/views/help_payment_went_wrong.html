  The prisoner has not recieved the money</h2>

      <p>
        While the money is likely to have reached the prison in 1-3 working days, it may not have been credited to the prisoner yet. Sometimes the money has been credited to the prisoner's account but the prisoner has not yet been able to view their account balance.
      </p>

      <h2 id="help-with-debit-cards" class="heading-medium mtp-help__section">
        The money was returned to you unexpectedly</h2>

        <p>
          You may have used an incorrect reference. If this is the case, you’ll receive a refund within 4 working days of making the transfer. Your bank statement will show ‘GBS RE NOMS AGENCY’ and the reference will be ‘refund’.
        </p>


        <h2 id="help-with-debit-cards" class="heading-medium mtp-help__section">
          A transfer won't go through</h2>

          <p>
            When you make a transfer at a bank branch or from an international bank account, your payment won't go through. That means we can't credit the prisoner and you'll have to request a refund. <a href="#">Please follow these steps</a>.
