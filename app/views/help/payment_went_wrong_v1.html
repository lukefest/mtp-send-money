        Something went wrong with a payment
      </h1>

<!-- HELP -->

<p>
  Occasionally, something can go wrong with a payment. Here are solutions to the most common errors.
</p>


      <h2 id="help-with-debit-cards" class="heading-medium mtp-help__section">
  The prisoner did not receive the money
</h2>

      <p>
        While the money is likely to have reached the prison in 1-3 working days, it may not have been credited to the prisoner yet. Sometimes the money has been credited to the prisoner's account but the prisoner has not yet been able to view their account balance.
      </p>

      <h2 id="help-with-debit-cards" class="heading-medium mtp-help__section">
        The money was returned unexpectedly
      </h2>

        <h2 id="help-with-debit-cards" class="heading-medium mtp-help__section">
          A bank transfer didnâ€™t go through
        </h2>

          <p>
            When you make a transfer at a bank branch or from an international bank account, your payment won't go through. That means we can't credit the prisoner and you'll have to request a refund. <a href="#">Please follow these steps</a>.
